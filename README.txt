PELS (Pris- og Effektstyrt Energilagringssystem) helps you optimize energy usage in your home by managing when your largest energy consumers run. It keeps you within your power limits by intelligently shedding load from lower-priority devices when consumption approaches your limit, then restores them when headroom is available. It also supports price-based control using Norwegian spot prices and grid tariffs, adjusting temperature targets for cheap and expensive hours.

Set your capacity limit, assign priorities to your thermostats and water heaters, and let PELS handle the rest. You can define different modes like Home, Away, or Night, each with their own temperature targets and priorities, and switch between them through Flows or the built-in PELS Insights device.

Inspired by the Sparegris (Piggy Bank) Homey app.
