# Actuator Write Seam

This is the design-of-record for the **actuator** — a single seam every write
intent flows through to transport. It is the sequel to
[`observer-transport-split.md`](./observer-transport-split.md): it closes two
bullets that note left **deliberately deferred** (the transport `write(intent)`
abstract API, and observer ownership of the snapshot store) and adds a third
box the original split did not name — the actuator.

> Status: **in progress** — PR 1 (the seam + terminal-shed consumer) and the full
> PR 1b executor migration are **shipped** (stepped #1485, target #1489, binary
> #1490, and PR1b-final, which removed the executor's dead transport write members
> and added the `no-actuator-bypass` cruiser rule). The actuator is now the sole
> device write path. **PR 2 split:** **PR2a (the `getHomePowerW` read scalar →
> observer) is shipped** — `lib/observer/observedHomePower.ts` (`ObservedHomePower`)
> now owns the whole-home power read; transport pushes it via
> `observedStateDispatcher.setHomePowerW`. **PR2b (snapshot store → observer) is
> DEFERRED BY DECISION** (dual-store risk, no behavior change — see PR 2 below).
> **PR 3 (tighten) remains outstanding.** Train sequence at the end.
> Read [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) (device-state invariants) and
> [`observer-transport-split.md`](./observer-transport-split.md) first — this
> note assumes the `planned / commanded / observed / pending` vocabulary and
> the transport-is-the-SDK-leaf rule.

## The four boxes

| Box | Mandate | Vocabulary |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| **transport** (`lib/device/**`) | The only module that talks to the Homey SDK, in **both** directions. Produces normalized snapshots (read) and executes capability/channel writes (write). Resolves native-vs-flow internally because it owns the snapshot + SDK knowledge. | Homey capabilities, channels, flow cards |
| **observer** (`lib/observer/**`) | Consolidated state: snapshot store, freshness/staleness, alive/idle, settle resolution, and pure plan-blind interpretation. The single place anyone asks "what is true right now?" | `fresh / stale / unknown`, observed draw, observed on/off |
| **plan** (`lib/plan/**`) | Decides desired state ("what should run") and owns **cooldown admission** (shed/restore windows). | planned state, headroom, cooldowns |
| **actuator** (`lib/actuator/**`, new) | The single write seam. Translates a uniform, SDK-blind `DeviceCommand` into transport's write methods, and is the **only** module allowed to call them. Owns the intent→channel mapping (incl. flow-vs-native). | `{ binary / step / target }` control intents |

The executor (`lib/executor/**`) keeps its existing mandate — *issue / retry /
wait / skip + drift* — but on the write side it now hands a `DeviceCommand` to
the actuator instead of poking transport directly.

---

## The loop is an overlay, not a directory map

The four/five boxes are a **control-flow model**. The physical `lib/` tree has
~14 dirs that do not line up 1:1, and pretending otherwise is how this note
would rot. The honest mapping:

| Conceptual box | Physical home | Caveat |
|---|---|---|
| transport | `lib/device/**` (esp. `lib/device/transport/`) | `lib/device/` is **not** purely the SDK seam — it also carries the producer seams (`deviceActionProjection`, `deviceResidualKw`), per-device runtime (`managerRuntime`), and today the `shedBehaviorActuation` write leak. |
| observer | `lib/observer/**` | Clean. Owns the home-power read scalar (PR2a). The snapshot store stays on transport (PR2b, deferred by decision). |
| plan | `lib/plan/**` | Clean core, but its **inputs** are separate peers: `power`, `price`, `dailyBudget`, `objectives` feed plan but aren't loop stages — they sit *beside* it as producers (`executor > plan > {power, dailyBudget, price, objectives, observer}`). |
| executor | `lib/executor/**` | Clean. Loses its write half to the actuator. |
| **actuator** | `lib/actuator/**` | **New** — the only dir this train creates. |

Dirs that don't belong to any loop stage:

- **`lib/power/`** — whole-home measurement (a *producer*, not a loop box).
  It's upstream measurement feeding observer/plan/device; the loop diagram's
  "reads" arrow elides it.
- **`lib/objectives/`** — smart tasks / deferred objectives. A plan-input peer
  that *also* triggers writes via the lifecycle (the
  `deferredObjectiveLifecycle` leak), so it straddles plan-input **and**
  actuation-trigger. After this train it triggers writes through the actuator
  (injected by wiring), not by hand-assembling a transport adapter.
- **`lib/planContract/`, `lib/flowApi/`, `lib/diagnostics/`, `lib/logging/`,
  `lib/utils/`** — cross-cutting / infra, orthogonal to the loop.
- **`lib/app/`** — sunsetting wiring; holds `appSnapshotHelpers`
  (its home-power read was re-pointed to the observer in PR2a; it still reads
  the snapshot store from transport, which stays put per PR2b's deferral).

**Scope discipline:** this train does **not** re-home the producer seams out of
`lib/device/`, nor split `lib/objectives/`, nor finish `lib/app/` dissolution.
It overlays the *write-path* vocabulary (transport / actuator) and makes three
bounded moves (actuator box, store→observer, the two leaks). The broader
dir-vs-loop reconciliation is a separate effort and may not be worth the BC
cost — flag candidates, don't chase them here.

---

## Control flow is one closed loop

A **data-flow cycle is not a dependency cycle.** Transport is a single bottom
leaf with two *injected ports*: a read-feed out (it pushes normalized
snapshots/events to observer via the `observedStateDispatcher` callback bag —
observer never imports transport) and a write-port in (the actuator calls a
transport write interface, injected as a local type — not the concrete class).
The loop is tied off at the **wiring layer** (`setup/`), which is exactly where
cycles are allowed to be closed. Transport therefore occupies **one** layer;
the cycle merely passes through it twice.

```

- **Full cycle** (something should change): all boxes.
- **Reconcile / drift** (close a gap): the inner loop
  `transport → observer → executor → actuator → transport`. The executor acts
  on the **committed plan** (with its cooldown gates) — it does not re-derive
  desired state, but it also cannot outrun plan's shed/restore cooldowns.
- **Settlement** is the dashed feedback, **not** a pipeline stage and **not**
  the actuator's job: transport *opens* a settle window at write time
  (`binarySettleOps.start` inside `setCapability`), observer *resolves* it from
  the next observations and emits `plan_reconcile` on drift.

---

## The two write contracts

The actuator and transport differ in **altitude**, and that difference is the
actuator's entire reason to exist (otherwise it is a pass-through).

### Transport write input — mechanism, Homey-shaped

Names capabilities, channels, flow cards. Today, four concrete methods on
`DeviceTransport`:

```
setCapability(deviceId, capabilityId, value)                       // deviceTransport.ts:1890
requestSteppedLoadStep({ deviceId, profile, desiredStepId,         // deviceTransport.ts:1980
                         planningPowerW, planningCurrentA, … })     //   (routes native↔flow internally)
applyDeviceTargets(targets)                                        // deviceTransport.ts:2066
triggerFlowBackedBinaryControl(deviceId, capabilityId, value)
```

Vocabulary: *"poke this Homey channel with this payload."* Transport keeps the
native-vs-flow routing for stepped loads because that choice is
snapshot-dependent SDK knowledge it already owns
(`isNativeSteppedLoadControlEnabled`).

### Actuator write input — control intent, SDK-blind

A single uniform `DeviceCommand` the executor decides, naming a *control
outcome* — never a flow card or synthetic channel:

```ts
// As shipped in lib/actuator/deviceCommand.ts. `flowBacked` is producer-resolved
// (see below); the actuator only routes on it. The executor's setpoint path (PR 1b)
// will likely add a capability-addressed `target` variant alongside the
// applyDeviceTargets-backed one here.
type DeviceCommand =
  | { kind: 'binary'; deviceId: string; control: 'onoff' | 'evcharger_charging'; desired: boolean; flowBacked: boolean }
  | { kind: 'target'; deviceId: string; value: number; contextInfo?: string }
  | { kind: 'step';   deviceId: string; profile: SteppedLoadProfile; desiredStepId: string;
      planningPowerW: number; planningCurrentA: number;
      actuationMode?: 'plan' | 'reconcile'; previousStepId?: string };
```

The actuator is the **only** translator from this intent vocabulary down to the
four transport methods, and the **only** importer of the transport write
interface. It also absorbs the one decision that currently leaks upward — the
flow-vs-native binary choice at `binaryControlDispatch.ts:159`
(`isFlowBackedBinaryControl(snapshot, capabilityId)`) — so the executor stops
branching on channel.

### The boundary test

- Field names a **Homey capability ID, flow card, or native/synthetic
  channel** → **transport** input.
- Field names a **control outcome** (on/off / step / setpoint) for a device →
  **actuator** input.

`control: 'evcharger_charging'` passes the test: it names *which binary to
drive*, not an SDK channel, so it belongs on actuator input.

---

## EV / binary consolidation

EV start/stop and generic on/off are already **one dispatch path** today,
distinguished only by `capabilityId: 'onoff' | 'evcharger_charging'`
(`binaryControlDispatch.ts:52`). The actuator formalizes this: EV is **not** a
distinct intent — it is a `binary` command whose `control` discriminant is
`evcharger_charging`.

- **Folds into `binary`:** EV start/stop + every on/off device.
- **Does *not* fold into `binary`:** EV *amperage stepping* is the `step` kind
  (native EV current control); thermostat setpoint is the `target` kind. EV has
  two control modes; only start/stop is binary.
- **Stays upstream, never reaches the actuator:** EV *commandability* — plug
  state, "must be plugged in," grace windows — is producer-resolved as
  `commandableNow` in the `deviceActionProjection` seam. By the time a `binary`
  command exists, the device is already deemed commandable; the actuator never
  re-checks EV plug state.

So EV-ness shrinks to a `control` discriminant on one command kind.

---

## What the actuator does **not** own

Keeping these explicit prevents the seam from accreting policy:

- **Cooldowns** (shed 60 s; restore 60–300 s exponential backoff) are
  **planning constraints** — `lib/plan/planConstants.ts`, enforced in
  `planHeadroomState.ts:376` and `restore/timing.ts:135`. The actuator sees
  only post-admission intents.
- **Settle window** is opened inside `transport.setCapability` and resolved by
  observer; the actuator does not open, close, or read it.
- **Pending-command recording** happens at dispatch (today
  `recordPendingForDispatch` in `binaryControlDispatch.ts`, just before the
  write) and is evicted by observer's per-cycle sync. (Whether pending-record
  *initiation* moves into the actuator is a PR-3 question — see train below; it
  is decoupled from the write call either way.)
- **Drift detection / retry policy** stay in the executor.
- **EV commandability** stays in the producer seam (above).

---

## Two write leaks this seam closes

These are writes issued from the wrong layer today; the actuator absorbs both:

1. `lib/device/shedBehaviorActuation.ts:203` — the **device layer** issuing a
   binary off via `transport.setCapability`. Mechanism-with-policy in the SDK
   leaf. Moves to the actuator.
2. `setup/appInit/deferredObjectiveLifecycle.ts:139` — **wiring** hand-assembling
   its own `ShedActuationTransport` from `deviceManager`. Replaced by depending
   on the actuator.

---

## Dependency-cruiser rules (to add / promote)

Transport stays the sole SDK owner. The actuator does **not** import it — the
write surface (`ActuatorTransport`) is a *local interface* the wiring layer
injects, so the actuator carries no peer dependency at all. It is a **pure
leaf**, like observer/price.

- `no-actuator-to-peer` *(shipped, PR 1)* — `lib/actuator/**` must not import any
  peer (`device / power / plan / price / dailyBudget / objectives / observer /
  executor`). The transport is injected, never imported. Plus `lib/actuator/`
  added to `no-domain-to-app-layer`.
- The existing `no-plan-to-device` and `no-executor-to-device-internals` rules
  (both `severity: 'error'`, already passing) keep plan/executor off the concrete
  `DeviceTransport`. There is **no** `todo-narrow-plan-device-dep` rule and never
  was; nothing is being promoted from warn→error here.
- `no-actuator-bypass` *(NEW cruiser rule; **shipped in PR1b-final**)* —
  `lib/plan/**` and `lib/executor/**` RECEIVE an injected `Actuator`; they must
  not reach into the actuator package to build or wire their own write path. The
  rule forbids any **value** import from `lib/actuator/**` — notably
  `createDeviceActuator` (only `setup/**` may call it, via
  `setup/appInit/buildDeviceActuator.ts`). The legitimate edge,
  `import type { Actuator }`, is erased and therefore invisible to the cruise, so
  it stays allowed automatically. **Scope:**
  `from: ^lib/(plan|executor)/ → to: ^lib/actuator/`. It complements
  `no-plan-to-device` / `no-executor-to-device-internals` (which only cover
  `lib/device/**`) by closing the actuator-side bypass. **Verified real:** passes
  clean on the shipped code (plan/executor hold only `import type` edges) AND
  fires on a value-import probe of `createDeviceActuator`
  (`error no-actuator-bypass: …→ lib/actuator/deviceActuator.ts`) — it is not a
  hollow rule. (An earlier draft scoped it to the type-only
  `lib/actuator/deviceCommand.ts`, which would have been hollow — that module
  exports only types, and with `tsPreCompilationDeps` unset there is no value
  import to catch.) Post-compilation, so it catches VALUE imports, not
  `import type` edges; the residual "no raw `.setCapability()` call" guarantee is
  **structural** (see the honesty note), not a cruiser rule.
- `device-no-actuation` — `lib/device/**` hosts no control actuation. Achieved
  *structurally* in PR 1 by relocating the terminal-shed actuator out of
  `lib/device/`; the existing `no-device-to-peer-except-power` already blocks any
  attempt to re-add a `lib/device → lib/actuator` call.

> Honesty note: dependency-cruiser is import-based, so the "only the actuator
> writes" invariant is enforced *structurally* plus by the rules above, not by a
> pure rule that says "no `.setCapability` call here." As of PR1b-final the
> structural half is now load-bearing: the executor's transport view
> (`PlanExecutorDeviceTransport`) is **`= DeviceObservation`** — read-only, with no
> write members at all — and the `PlanExecutorTargetContext.deviceManager` lost its
> `setCapability` member too, so there is no transport write surface for the
> executor to call; every write goes through the injected `Actuator`. The
> `no-actuator-bypass` rule (now shipped) additionally forbids plan/executor from
> **value**-importing anything out of `lib/actuator/**` (notably
> `createDeviceActuator`); the `import type { Actuator }` edge is erased and stays
> allowed. Code review still covers the residue a post-compilation import rule
> cannot see (a raw write call, an `import type` edge).

## Migration train

Each PR is independently shippable and leaves the build green. Opener is the
substantial write-model piece, not the store move.

**PR 1 — stand up the actuator seam; terminal-shed is its first consumer.** *Shipped.*

Scoped narrower than first sketched, because the executor's binary/stepped/target
dispatch turned out to be an entangled actuation *subsystem* (decision-shaped
logging, pending bookkeeping, retry/backoff), not a set of bare `setCapability`
calls — folding it in here would be the "many-CI-rounds" trap. But
`lib/device/shedBehaviorActuation.ts` was already a scoped actuator (its own
intent union + injected transport surface), so it became the natural seed.

- New `lib/actuator/`: `deviceCommand.ts` (the `DeviceCommand` union +
  `ActuatorTransport` injected write surface + `ActuatorOutcome`) and
  `deviceActuator.ts` (`createDeviceActuator` → `Actuator.apply`, mapping
  intent → transport method, routing binary on the producer-resolved `flowBacked`
  flag).
- Relocated the terminal-shed actuator `lib/device/shedBehaviorActuation.ts` →
  `lib/actuator/terminalShedActuation.ts`, refactored to issue writes through
  `actuator.apply()` instead of poking transport. **Kills the device-layer write
  leak.**
- Wiring: `buildShedActuationTransport` → `buildShedActuator` constructs the
  injected transport + the actuator; `deferredObjectiveLifecycle` consumes the
  actuator and passes the step-bookkeeping callback separately. **Kills the
  hand-built-transport leak.**
- Cruiser: `no-actuator-to-peer` + `lib/actuator/` added to
  `no-domain-to-app-layer`.
- Tests: `deviceActuator.test.ts` (intent→method mapping incl. EV `control`
  discriminant, flow-vs-native, step passthrough) + relocated
  `terminalShedActuation.test.ts` + reworked `deferredTerminalEnding.test.ts`.

**PR 1b — migrate the executor dispatch subsystem onto the actuator.** *Shipped.*
Split into sub-PRs so each is independently shippable and behavior-preserving:

- **PR1b-1 — stepped.** *Shipped (#1485).* Inject the shared `Actuator` into the
  plan engine + executor (via wiring's `buildDeviceActuator`, lifted out of the
  terminal-shed `buildShedActuator` so both paths share one builder) and route the
  executor's stepped binding (`planExecutor` `requestSteppedLoadStep`) through
  `actuator.apply({ kind: 'step', ... })`. `steppedLoadExecutor.ts` is unchanged —
  only the binding routes through the actuator; behavior is identical.
- **PR1b-2 — target.** *Shipped (#1489).* Re-point `targetExecutor` / the
  `setCapability` setpoint path through the actuator, adding the
  capability-addressed `target` variant (`target.capabilityId`) to `DeviceCommand`
  for the per-capability setpoint write.
- **PR1b-3 — binary.** *Shipped (#1490).* Re-point `binaryControlDispatch` through
  the actuator; move the flow-vs-native binary decision
  (`isFlowBackedBinaryControl`) to the producer so the command carries a resolved
  `flowBacked`, matching the terminal-shed path; hoist the flow-log and delete the
  now-redundant `isFlowBackedBinaryControl` recompute on the dispatch path.
- **PR1b-final — close out.** *Shipped (this PR).* Removed the now-dead transport
  write members from the executor's transport view: `PlanExecutorDeviceTransport`
  is now `= DeviceObservation` (read-only) and `PlanExecutorTargetContext`'s
  `deviceManager` lost `setCapability`. Added the `no-actuator-bypass` cruiser rule
  now that all three write sites are migrated and the actuator is the sole write
  path (see the rules section for why it could not land earlier). No behavior
  change.
- Keep logging/pending/retry where they are unless a clean home emerges — this
  train is about the write seam, not relocating the executor's bookkeeping.

  **Future cleanup (NOT this PR):** the binary path still *re-resolves* the
  flow-vs-native decision after the write — `isFlowBackedBinaryControl(...)` is
  recomputed at three post-write consumer sites in `binaryExecutor.ts`
  (~lines 372 / 427 / 595) to decide whether the command was flow-backed when
  recording confirmation. PR1b-3 hoisted the *dispatch-path* recompute but left
  these consumer-side re-resolutions; folding them onto the producer-resolved
  `flowBacked` the command already carries is a follow-up, decoupled from the write
  seam.

**PR 2 — move the read model to observer.** Split into PR2a (shipped) and PR2b
(deferred by decision) once the two halves were found to have very different
risk profiles.

**PR2a — `getHomePowerW` → observer. *Shipped.***
- New `lib/observer/observedHomePower.ts` (`ObservedHomePower`) owns the
  whole-home power scalar. `DeviceTransport` no longer caches `latestHomePowerW`
  or exposes `getHomePowerW()`; it is removed from the `DeviceObservation`
  interface too.
- `updateHomePowerFromReport` pushes the resolved scalar to the observer via a
  new `setHomePowerW(w)` method on the `observedStateDispatcher` callback bag —
  the same injection pattern as the event dispatcher and `pendingPredicate`;
  transport still does not statically import observer.
- Re-pointed the sole external reader, `lib/app/appSnapshotHelpers.ts`
  (`recordImplicitHomeyEnergySample`), to a `getHomePowerW` dep wired in `app.ts`
  to read from the observer (lib/app → observer is an allowed edge). The
  `homey_energy` poll path is unchanged: `pollHomePowerW()` still returns the
  resolved scalar directly to `HomeyEnergyPollSource`.
- **Source correction:** the value originates from a Homey SDK energy report read
  in the device layer (`managerFetch` → `managerHomeyApi` → `managerEnergy`), not
  from `lib/power/`. Observer introduces no `lib/power/**` import — the original
  "via event/contract from `lib/power/`" wording was wrong about the source.

**PR2b — snapshot store → observer. *DEFERRED BY DECISION (not done).***
- Relocating `latestSnapshot` / `latestSnapshotById` from `DeviceTransport` to
  the observer would be a **dual-store**: transport keeps the array as a pipeline
  scratchpad (the parse/merge/realtime pipeline mutates it in place during
  `refreshSnapshot`), and transport cannot import observer
  (`no-device-to-peer-except-power`). The move buys **no behavior change** while
  adding a high snapshot-rollback regression surface (the merge/realtime
  freshness invariants in `CLAUDE.md`).
- Not worth doing until the read-side parse/merge pipeline itself relocates out
  of transport. The external snapshot reader `lib/plan/snapshotWarmupGate.ts`
  stays on transport for now.

**PR 3 — tighten.**
- Promote warn-level rules to error; retire transitional allowances.
- Decide whether pending-record *initiation* moves into the actuator (it is
  already decoupled from the write call, so this is a clarity move, not a
  correctness one).
- Reconcile `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and this note's status →
  shipped.

---

## Open questions

- **Pending-record home (PR 3):** keep at dispatch, or move into the actuator?
  Leaning keep-at-dispatch unless a second caller needs it, to avoid the
  actuator growing bookkeeping.
- **`applyDeviceTargets` vs per-capability `target`:** confirm whether the
  `target` command kind should fan to `applyDeviceTargets` (batch) or
  `setCapability` (single). Today both paths exist; the actuator should pick one
  per call site without changing observed behavior.
