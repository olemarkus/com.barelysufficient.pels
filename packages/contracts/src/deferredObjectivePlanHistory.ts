// `'stalled'` is the idle-classifier `near_target_idle` promotion: the
// device stopped drawing close to its setpoint, so PELS declared the
// objective satisfied without the progress series literally crossing the
// target threshold. See `notes/idle-classification.md` for the 5 °C / 15
// min thresholds and the Connected 300 worked example. Added in v2.7.3.
//
// `'stalled_device_capped'` is the idle-classifier `capped_idle`
// promotion: the device parked at a stable plateau several degrees below
// the PELS-commanded target while its power cycled around its own internal
// thermostat cap (e.g. a Connected 300 capped internally at ~60 °C with a
// 65 °C smart-task target). The recorder accepts this as `met` so the run
// doesn't read as a false miss, but the distinct reason lets the
// postmortem name the device's own setpoint cap as the cause — not the
// PELS-canonical hard cap (per `feedback_hard_cap_is_physical.md`).
// Added in v2.9.x.
