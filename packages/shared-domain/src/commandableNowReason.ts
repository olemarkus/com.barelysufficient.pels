/**
 * Canonical home for the EV-charger reason strings surfaced when a device
 * is not commandable in the current cycle.
 *
 * Three runtime producers emit these strings today:
 *
 *  - `lib/device/deviceActionProjection.ts:resolveCommandableNow`
 *    (the new producer-seam home, fed onto `commandableNowReason`)
 *  - `lib/device/deviceActionProjection.ts:getEvRestoreBlockReason`
 *    (legacy snapshot-shape helper for the binary-control planner)
 *  - `lib/plan/restore/devices.ts:getEvRestoreStateBlockReason`
 *    (legacy restore-eligibility gate, surfaced via `DeviceReason.detail`)
 *
 * Both routes feed UI surfaces (status chips, device cards, plan reason
 * detail text), so per `feedback_ui_text_shared_with_logs` the literals
 * live in `packages/shared-domain/**` and both producers import from one
 * source. The strings are byte-for-byte identical to the prior inline
 * literals — no user-visible change.
 *
 * Browser-safe: no Homey SDK types, no runtime imports.
